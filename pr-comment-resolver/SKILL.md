# PR Comment Resolver

Analyze and apply GitHub PR review comments locally, flagging suggestions that don't make sense.

## When to Use

- Addressing code review feedback on a PR
- Resolving Copilot automated suggestions
- Fixing multiple PR comments in bulk
- Applying reviewer suggestions after code review

## The Iron Law

```
ANALYZE BEFORE APPLYING. FLAG WHAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. NEVER COMMIT OR RESOLVE WITHOUT USER PERMISSION.
```

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- `jq` installed for JSON processing
- Local clone of the repository
- On the PR branch — Phase 0 verifies this and auto-switches if needed

## Input Formats

Accept PR URLs in any format:
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`
- `owner/repo#123`
- Just `123` if already in the repo

## Execution

### Phase 0: Verify Branch

Before doing anything else, confirm the working directory is on the PR's head branch.

```bash
# Get the PR's head branch name
pr_branch=$(gh pr view <pr_number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')

# Get the current local branch
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
```

**Decision:**
- `current_branch == pr_branch` → Proceed to Phase 1
- `current_branch != pr_branch` → Switch automatically with `gh pr checkout <pr_number>`, then confirm the switch succeeded before continuing. If the checkout fails (e.g., uncommitted changes), ask the user to resolve it.

**NEVER skip this check.** Applying fixes on the wrong branch means the push will go to the wrong place and verify-and-resolve.sh will resolve threads against code that isn't in the PR.

### Phase 1: Fetch Unresolved Comments

```bash
# Extract owner/repo/number from URL, then run:
./scripts/fetch-unresolved.sh <owner> <repo> <pr_number>
```

Script handles:
- Pagination (fetches all threads, not just first 50)
- Retries with stepped backoff (0s, 2s, 5s) for transient failures
- Rate limit detection (string match on response) and retry
- Suggestion block parsing

Output: JSON array of unresolved comments with fields:
- `threadId`, `path`, `line`, `body`, `author` — core fields used by verify-and-resolve.sh
- `commentId` — included for reference/logging but not required by verify-and-resolve.sh
- `startLine` — start of the comment's line range (null if single-line)
- `side` — diff side: `"RIGHT"` (PR head) or `"LEFT"` (base)
- `outdated` (boolean) — thread marked outdated by GitHub
- `hasSuggestion` (boolean), `suggestionCode` (string|null)
- `suggestionStartLine`, `suggestionEndLine` — line range for suggestions
- `originalCode` — code context from diff hunk (RIGHT side for PR head, LEFT side for base)
- `replies` — array of reply comment bodies (for conversation context)

### Phase 2: Analyze & Apply (LOCAL ONLY)

For each comment in JSON output:

**Decision Tree:**

```
1. Is it a suggestion block? (hasSuggestion: true)
   ├─ If suggestionCode is null → Treat as interpretive (parse failed, likely CRLF)
   ├─ If outdated: true → Flag "GitHub marked stale"
   └─ Does file at path:line contain originalCode?
       ├─ Yes → Apply suggestionCode directly (replace lines)
       └─ No → Flag "outdated suggestion — code has changed"

2. Is it an interpretive comment?
   ├─ Read target file, understand intent
   ├─ Makes sense? → Edit file using Edit tool, track change
   └─ Unclear/wrong? → Flag with reason

3. Is it a question/discussion?
   └─ Skip — not actionable
```

**Apply when:**
- Corrects an actual bug or inconsistency
- Aligns with project conventions
- Localized fix that won't break other code
- Suggestion block with matching target code

**Flag and skip when:**
- Misunderstands the code's intent
- Would introduce a bug
- Ambiguous or contradictory
- Insufficient context to apply confidently
- Outdated suggestion (code has changed)
- Question or discussion (not actionable)

### Phase 3: Report Results

Output during processing:
```
✓ file.js:55 — [suggestion] Applied null coalescing operator
✓ config.ts:42 — [interpreted] Added error handling
⊘ api.ts:18 — SKIPPED: Question, not actionable
⊘ utils.js:30 — SKIPPED: Outdated suggestion — code has changed
```

Summary report:
```
## PR Comment Resolution Summary

**Applied (suggestion):** N changes
**Applied (interpreted):** M changes
**Skipped:** K comments

### Applied Changes
- `file.js:55` — [suggestion] Replaced || with ??
- `config.ts:42` — [interpreted] Added null check before access

### Skipped (Needs Review)
- `api.ts:18` — Question, not actionable
- `utils.js:30` — Outdated suggestion — code has changed

### Next Steps
Would you like me to commit, push, and resolve the applied comments?
```

### Phase 4: User Permission Gate

<HARD-GATE>
ASK: "Commit, push, and resolve N comments? [y/N]"
STOP and wait for explicit "yes" before proceeding.
NEVER commit changes or resolve threads without user permission.
</HARD-GATE>

### Phase 5: Verify, Commit, Push, Resolve

Only after user confirms:

**Step 1: Commit changes**

Use the format from `assets/commit-message.tpl`:
```bash
# Stage ONLY the files that were edited during Phase 2 (avoid git add -A)
# Use the tracked list of applied changes to stage specific files
git add <list-of-modified-files> && git commit -m "fix: address PR review comments

Applied N changes from PR #123:
- file.js:55 — [suggestion] Replaced || with ??
- config.ts:42 — [interpreted] Added null check

Skipped M comments (see PR for details)"
```

**Step 2: Push**
```bash
git push
```

**Step 3: Verify and resolve each applied fix**

For each applied change, verify BEFORE resolving:
```bash
./scripts/verify-and-resolve.sh <owner> <repo> <thread_id> <file_path> "<search_pattern>" "<reply_message>"
```

The `<search_pattern>` should be a **plain literal substring** from the applied change (`grep -F` matches literally). Choose patterns that are:
- Unique enough to verify the fix (a comment or variable name from the change)
- Free of shell special characters (`!`, `$`, `` ` ``, `\`) — these get mangled inside double quotes
- **Good:** `"Auto-append marker if caller"`, `"comments(first: 100)"`, `"addPullRequestReviewThreadReply"`
- **Bad:** `'REPLY_MESSAGE" != *"$MARKER"'` (the `!` and `$` corrupt the pattern)

The `<reply_message>` should follow the format in `assets/reply.tpl`: `"Fixed — <description>"`. The idempotency marker (`<!-- Applied by pr-comment-resolver -->`) is auto-appended by the script if missing — callers do not need to include it.

For outdated threads already fixed in prior commits, use `--skip-verify`. Pass `-` as a placeholder for `<file_path>` and `<search_pattern>` (these args are ignored when `--skip-verify` is set, but must be present for positional parsing):
```bash
./scripts/verify-and-resolve.sh <owner> <repo> <thread_id> - - "<reply_message>" --skip-verify
```

**Parallel execution:** All verify-and-resolve calls can run in parallel for speed. However, if one call fails, the remaining parallel calls may be cancelled. Retry failed calls individually after the batch.

Output verification results:
```
Verifying fixes in files...
✓ file.js:55 — VERIFIED: Pattern found, thread resolved
✓ config.ts:42 — VERIFIED: Pattern found, thread resolved
✗ api.ts:30 — NOT FOUND: Fix not in file, thread NOT resolved
⊘ helpers.py — SKIPPED verification (outdated, --skip-verify), thread resolved
```

**CRITICAL:** Only resolve comments whose fixes are verified present in the pushed code (or confirmed fixed via `--skip-verify` for outdated threads).

## Error Handling

| Exit Code | Script | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| 0 | fetch-unresolved.sh | Success | Continue |
| 1 | fetch-unresolved.sh | Auth error | Stop: "Run `gh auth login`" |
| 2 | fetch-unresolved.sh | PR not found or API error | Stop: "Verify PR URL; if correct, retry (may be transient)" |
| 3 | fetch-unresolved.sh | Rate limited | Stop: "GitHub rate limit, try in 15 min" |
| 0 | verify-and-resolve.sh | Resolved | Report success |
| 1 | verify-and-resolve.sh | Verification failed | Report "Fix not found — NOT resolved" |
| 2 | verify-and-resolve.sh | API error | Report "Failed to resolve — manual action needed" |
| 3 | verify-and-resolve.sh | Already resolved | Skip silently |

## Edge Cases

| Edge Case | Detection | Handling |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Comment on deleted file | `path` not in local repo | Skip: "File deleted — cannot apply" |
| Outdated suggestion | `originalCode` not in file at line | Skip: "Code changed since suggestion" |
| Binary file | File extension check | Skip: "Binary file — manual review needed" |
| Merge conflict markers | `<<<<<<<` in target file | Stop: "Resolve merge conflicts first" |
| Not on PR branch | Phase 0 branch check | Auto-switch via `gh pr checkout`; if fails, stop and ask user |
| Empty PR | JSON output is `[]` | Exit: "No unresolved comments found" |
| Deleted lines | Line number > file length | Skip: "Target line no longer exists" |

## Known Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `FORBIDDEN` on reply posting | Using wrong GraphQL mutation | Script uses `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` (not `addPullRequestReviewComment` which requires a pending review) |
| Verification fails on valid fix | Shell special chars in search pattern (`!`, `$`, `` ` ``) | Choose plain alphanumeric substrings from the change |
| Parallel resolve batch partially fails | One bad pattern cancels remaining calls | Retry failed calls individually after the batch completes |
| Duplicate replies on retry | Caller omitted idempotency marker | Script auto-appends marker since v2.1; no action needed |
| `originalCode` mismatch on RIGHT-side comments | Was extracting base side of diff | Fixed in v2.1 to extract PR head side (`+` lines) for RIGHT-side comments |
